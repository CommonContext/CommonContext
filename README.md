## The Problem
DBC has the stated mission of increasing diversity in tech. However, tech companies could be doing more to support new bootcamp grads make meaningful connections that will help them get placed in a role they're well suited for.

## The Solution
Common Context matches aspiring developers, based on their demographic context, rather than existing network, with mentors working in the field, and promotes nurturing connections.

## App Usage Flow

* A user logs in and signs up as a mentor using their Linkedin credentials.
* The mentor then creates an appointment time slot.
* An aspiring developer logs in using their Linkedin credentials and signs up as a mentee.
* The mentee requests matches for mentors to connect with, and then chooses their preferred match.
* The mentee then selects the time slot available to them based on their matched mentor's preferences.
* Both mentor and mentee can view their appointments in the calendar and reschedule their meeting if necessary.
